# Hello, World!

Finally got this working with pure Jekyll. Your original design is intact, and now:

- Homepage auto-lists posts with titles & dates
- Clean URL: `/welcome-to-my-blog`
- Just add new `.md` files here (e.g., `2025-12-02-next-post.md`)
- Push → live in 30s, no JS edits, no failures

**Markdown magic:** Bold, *italics*, lists, code blocks—all work.

<img src="/profile.jpg" alt="Profile" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:8px; margin:1rem 0;">

Let's build something awesome.
